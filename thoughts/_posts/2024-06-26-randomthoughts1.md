  Personal space is sacred.

Most spiritual practices are about approaching a level of self-awareness in an attempt to fully become familiar with who we are. Is there an I? And if so, who am I? So often does this question come up when we live our lives, and as time goes by, hopefully, we begin to make progress towards answering it. Just as I was thinking this, I realized that despite where I am on that road to self-discovery within myself, there is so much that I've already expressed in a space I can call my own. 

## Personal space is sacred.  

People's spaces are very intimate because of how they reflect an identity.

I don't think this concept is as intuitive as it sounds. Having a space to call your own, whether it's the corner of a prison cell, the top bunk in a cabin, or even just a desk in the garage, is so important. It's a dimension where, even if we're alone, we can enjoy our own company being surrounded by belongings that have a deeper meaning to us.

It's funny how our egos can be so elusive when confronted with accepting our mistakes, and yet so blunt and bold when it comes to finding tangible totems to represent our personalities. Unfortunately, not all of us are far enough in our spiritual journey to have transcended the need for materialistic pleasures that come with owning "stuff."

Sometimes it can mean the world to have a space just to process yourself and work things out. Generally, we develop that place by spilling a bit of ourselves into it. Whatever this environment looks like for you, I sincerely hope the people around you respect it.
