Two concepts that are fundamental to understanding Hinduism are <span style="color:turquoise">Karma</span> and <span style="color:turquoise">Dharma</span>. Karma is the law of cause and effect, where no good or evil is represented through angels and demons. It arises from every action we take, influenced not just by what we do but also by our intentions. Everyone's wellbeing is dictated by Karma, rather than any dogmatic rule of "sin."

Dharma is a deeper concept, referring to the path in one's life that resonates most with them. It is a calling, a way of life that leads to an optimum livelihood for both oneself and those around them.

<span style="color:turquoise">Vishwadharma</span> represents the entire Universe's dharma. Just as one's dharma acts as a compass to navigate their life, Vishwadharma serves as the path that will blossom the best reality for all. Preserving the integrity of the Universe's dharmic compass is precisely the role that Lord Vishnu plays in the Hindu pantheon. This is a role he has carried out time and again by manifesting as different Avatars and vanquishing sources of dharmic imbalance.

When he incarnated as his 7th Avatar, <span style="color:turquoise">Sri Rama</span>, he ushered in a legendary era of righteousness. He conquered the evils of his time and improved the lives of all those he came into contact with, including his enemies. He lived a poetically beautiful life, riddled with challenges which he overcame in exemplary fashion. Rama serves as a guide for Hindus today, inspiring them to find the best possible reactions to their situations. Being the embodiment of perfection, he is a guide for those looking to be bold and righteous leaders in every aspect of their lives.

<h1> Deity. </h1>

The ancient Rishis discovered that the entire universe is as present in every particle in space and time as the macro was observed to be holographically inherent in the micro. They observed certain patterns in nature periodically emerge as creation unfolds. From vortices and fractals to the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio, it's a well known fact that these patterns are not just aesthetically pleasing but also serve functional purposes. They reflect the efficiency, resilience, and beauty of natural designs. This parallel between the small and the large is not just a coincidence but a hint at the fundamental unity of the cosmos, where the same laws of physics apply across all scales. The Rishis realized this and believed they could explore the entirety of the universe by meditating within themselves. 

Although the roles of Brahmins and Sages were important, Hinduism does not necessitate a priesthood. Yoga is, in fact, an effort to realize this underlying truth within oneself. When acknowledged, this deep epiphany is called <span style="color:turquoise">Sat-Chit-Ananda</span> and can be discovered through many Tantras or methods. One such practice includes the worship of deities.

The deity, or "murthi," represents the micro presence of the macro universal source consciousness. The <span style="color:turquoise">Pran Pratishtha</span> (spiritual consecration of the deity) of Sri Ram in India was a global event for Hindus because it symbolized the Supreme defender of our universal Dharma finally coming back home.
