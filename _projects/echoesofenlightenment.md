This piece is a tribute to the rich tapestry of knowledge and cultural exchange that flourished between ancient India and Greece. At its heart lies the image of <span style="color:turquoise">Vasudeva Krishna</span> found on a coin from the ancient Greek kingdom of Bactra (180 - 200 BCE). It's existence sybolizes the spiritual and material wealth that ancient India shared with the world. Surrounding this figure on the left is the sillhouette of the <span style="color:turquoise">Gandhara Buddha</span>, representing the spread of Buddhism and its profound influence on Greek art and thought. 

The delicate lines of the <span style="color:turquoise">Bakshali manuscript</span> and the profound geometric equations of the <span style="color:turquoise">Sulba Sutras</span> weave through the composition, highlighting the advanced mathematical and scientific understanding of ancient Indian scholars. One particularly significant excerpt included in this piece is a passage from the <span style="color:turquoise">Sulba Sutras</span>, detailing the original Pythagorean theorem. This theorem, which Pythagoras is famously known for, was initially conceived in India and later introduced to Greece, underscoring the profound impact of Indian intellectual traditions on Greek philosophy and science. Together, these elements create a visual narrative that celebrates the rich exchange of wisdom and ideas between these two great civilizations. The artwork not only honors the historical connections between India and Greece but also serves as a reminder of the enduring legacy of their shared quest for knowledge and enlightenment.
