As the battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas rages on, Arjuna finds himself filled with doubt and confusion about his duty as a warrior. Seeking guidance, he turns to his charioteer and guide, <span style="color:turquoise">Kṛṣṇa</span>.

With immense compassion and love, <span style="color:turquoise">Kṛṣṇa</span> responds to Arjuna's plea for clarity. He assures Arjuna that he will reveal his supreme form, a manifestation of his true cosmic nature. As the battlefield becomes a sacred stage for the cosmic unveiling, <span style="color:turquoise">Kṛṣṇa's</span> majestic presence shines forth. Arjuna, overwhelmed by curiosity and reverence while also being desperate for understanding was the only one who could experience it.

<span style="color:turquoise">Kṛṣṇa's</span> form expands to an unimaginable scale, encompassing the entire universe. Arjuna's eyes traverse the three celestial systems known as: 
<ul>
<ul><span style="color:turquoise">Svarga</span> (heavenly realms) </ul>
<ul><span style="color:turquoise">Martya</span> (earthly realms)</ul> 
<ul><span style="color:turquoise">Patala</span> (subterranean realms)</ul>
</ul>

He sees the abodes of gods, demigods, celestial beings, and mighty sages residing in the higher realms. The beauty and opulence of these celestial abodes surpass anything he has ever imagined.

Arjuna's vision penetrates further into the 14 worlds described in Vedic cosmology: 
<ul>
 <span style="color:turquoise">Bhurloka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, Patala</span>
 
 </ul>

Each of these worlds had its own unique characteristics and inhabitants. They reflected the infinite diversity prevalent in the cosmos. He see's the lives of other-worldly creatures, humans, plants and animals as they go through similar rites of passage. He follows them until they eventually pass away only to return in the form of the next generation. 


In the vision, Arjuna comprehends the interconnectedness of all these realms and their significance in the grand tapestry of the universe.  He now understands the inevitability of their fates, truly recognizing the <span style="color:turquoise">Sanātana Dharma</span> (universal-dharma) for what it is. The experience shocks Arjuna into realizing his own place within this vast cosmic web. He understands that his duty as a warrior is not limited to the earthly realm alone but is intertwined with the harmonious functioning of the entire universe.


As the vision of the <span style="color:turquoise">विश्वरूप</span>(universal-form) gradually recedes, <span style="color:turquoise">Kṛṣṇa</span> reassumes his gentle and familiar state. From that moment on, Arjuna's devotion and trust in <span style="color:turquoise">Kṛṣṇa</span> deepens. Now armed with a complete understanding of his own dharma, he becomes committed to fulfilling his destined role on the battlefield.
