In college, I once took a class called The Telepresent Self. It focused on digital literacy and how the world is rapidly evolving toward a state where representing and advocating for oneself online has become just as—if not more—important than doing so in person. The internet presents a psychological filter of the identity we wish to be perceived as, rather than a true reflection of who we are. Yet, despite this distinction, the online self and the real self are becoming increasingly conflated. The internet has a way of intoxicating us, making it easy to believe that our digital persona is our true self. But in reality, it’s just a construct—a curated version of our existence designed to fit within the parameters of virtual spaces.

The way technology is shaping our society is unpredictable, but one thing is certain: we must become adept at adapting to these evolving norms. The rate at which we are technologically progressing far outpaces our biological evolution. Our ability to integrate new digital tools into daily life is advancing at an exponential rate, yet our psychological and physiological makeup remains largely unchanged. This gap creates a sense of dissonance—one that we often try to bridge <span style="color:turquoise">through convenience rather than genuine adaptation</span>.

## The Culture of Convenience: A Double-Edged Sword

A lot of modern technology has shifted from being helpful to simply making life easier—sometimes excessively so. We are entering an era where convenience is prioritized above all else, from fast food to pharmaceutical shortcuts like Ozempic, which is often used as a quick fix for weight loss instead of embracing the long-term discipline of healthy eating and exercise. While some of these advancements serve a genuine purpose, many have become a crutch, allowing us to bypass struggle rather than build resilience.

<span style="color:turquoise">Struggle is integral to growth.</span> Whether it’s the physical exertion required to stay fit or the mental endurance needed to master a skill, overcoming challenges is what makes achievements meaningful. Yet, we increasingly opt for the path of least resistance. What happens when we no longer feel the need to push ourselves? What happens when we no longer see value in struggle? In the pursuit of ultimate convenience, we risk losing something fundamental: the grit and perseverance that define the human experience.

We live in a world that values being telepresent more than being present. We carefully curate our online identities to project a certain image, but in doing so, we often disconnect from our actual experiences. Social media, remote work, and digital interactions have created a space where we are always connected, yet somehow less engaged with reality.

This conflict between digital and real-life personas is brilliantly explored in the show Severance. The dystopian series presents a world where employees voluntarily undergo a procedure to separate their work selves from their personal selves, effectively creating two distinct consciousnesses. It raises an unsettling question: How far are we willing to go to compartmentalize our lives? While Severance is an extreme metaphor, it highlights the growing divide between our online personas and our real-world experiences. We are fragmenting ourselves—not through surgery, but through the daily act of switching between our curated online presence and our physical existence.

## A Path Forward

<span style="color:turquoise">Technology is neither inherently good nor bad; it is simply a tool.</span> How we choose to use it will determine whether it enriches our lives or erodes our sense of self. Instead of blindly embracing every new convenience, we must cultivate awareness about how these tools shape our behaviors and mindsets. We need to strive for a balance—one that allows us to integrate technology into our lives without sacrificing authenticity, resilience, and real-world engagement.

As we continue to navigate the digital age, the challenge isn’t just learning how to be telepresent—it’s learning how to remain truly present in a world that increasingly demands we exist in both realms. The solution may not be easy, but it starts with awareness, intentionality, and a willingness to embrace the struggles that make us human.
