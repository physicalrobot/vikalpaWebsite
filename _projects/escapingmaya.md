In Hindu philosophy, <span style="color:turquoise">माया</span> (Maya) refers to the illusion or the cosmic force that creates a veil over our perception of reality. It suggests that the material world, with all its pleasures and pains, is not the ultimate reality but rather a temporary and deceptive aspect of existence. The attachment to ephemeral pleasures and material possessions fosters ignorance (<span style="color:turquoise">Avidya</span>), which further perpetuates the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (<span style="color:turquoise">Samsara</span>). The peril lies in mistaking the transient for the eternal, leading to suffering as we chase after desires that can never be permanently fulfilled; distracting us from the pursuit of true knowledge and liberation (<span style="color:turquoise">Moksha</span>), which lies in understanding the illusory nature of the world and realizing the eternal self (<span style="color:turquoise">Atman</span>) beyond it.

In Buddhism, the following six realms of <span style="color:turquoise">Samsara</span> are recognized:

- <span style="color:turquoise">देव</span> (Deva) - Represents attachment to pleasure and pride. Beings here experience immense pleasure but are blinded to the suffering of others and the impermanence of their state.

- <span style="color:turquoise">मनुष्य</span> (Human) - Signifies desire, passion, doubt, and the potential for enlightenment. It's considered the most favorable realm for spiritual growth because of the balance of pleasure and suffering.

- <span style="color:turquoise">असुर</span> (Titan) - Symbolizes jealousy and competitiveness. Beings here enjoy many pleasures but are constantly in conflict, driven by envy of the gods.

- <span style="color:turquoise">तिर्यग्योनि</span> (Animal) - Embodies ignorance, instinct, and survival. Beings here are driven by basic needs and lack the capacity for higher reasoning or spiritual development.

- <span style="color:turquoise">प्रेत</span> (Hungry Ghost) - Characterized by insatiable craving and addiction. Beings suffer from extreme hunger and thirst but cannot find satisfaction.

- <span style="color:turquoise">नरक</span> (Hell) - Represents anger, aggression, and hatred. Beings endure intense suffering and pain, often the result of harmful actions in past lives.
