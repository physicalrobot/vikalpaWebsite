Indra's Net is a metaphorical depiction of reality, representing the interconnectedness of all things.

According to Hindu cosmology, Indra is the ruler of higher realms. In his palace, Indra possesses a vast net that extends infinitely in all directions. At each intersection of the net's threads, there is a precious jewel that reflects all the other jewels in the net. These jewels symbolize individual beings or elements of existence. They represent our sense of "self". 

The crucial idea behind Indra's Net is that every jewel, representing an individual, reflects the entire net and all the other jewels within it. When any jewel changes or moves, it sends ripples through the entire net, affecting all other jewels. This interconnectedness implies that all things are intimately connected and influence one another. 

Every individual is interconnected with and dependent on everything else. Each person's actions and experiences have ripple effects that reverberate through the entire web of existence. Karma is just the natural consequence of existence. This interconnectedness is not limited to human beings but extends to all forms of life and even to inanimate objects.

The concept of Indra's Net encourages a shift in perspective from individuality to a recognition of the underlying unity of all things. It invites us to perceive the world as an interdependent and interconnected whole rather than a collection of isolated entities. By understanding our connection to everything else, we can develop a sense of empathy, compassion, and responsibility towards the world.

Indra's Net is a profound metaphorical depiction of the interconnectedness of all things in Hindu mythology. It teaches us that every individual and element of existence reflects and is connected to the entirety of the web, and any action or change affects the whole. Understanding this interconnectedness encourages a shift in perspective, fostering empathy, compassion, and a sense of responsibility towards the world.
