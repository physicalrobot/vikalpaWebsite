A ceremony was held to find one worthy enough to win the divine princess Sita's hand in marriage. It was decided that only a man strong enough to lift Lord Shiva's Bow by himself would be considered a suitable husband. 
Many kings and princes traveled from afar in hopes of securing a proposal. Countless would try, ultimately failing to even move the sacred bow. It seemed to weigh more than anyone could possibly imagine. 

None of their attempts mattered after Prince Ram stepped up. He single handedly lifted the bow shocking the audience immedietly. He then proceeded to string the legendary weapon, bending the frame until it snapped with a thunderous boom. It echoed in every direction, almost like a declaration of his worthiness. The sound was only matched by the cheers that followed after from the crowd. No one came close to being as capable. It was as if Sita finding Ram was too natural to be stopped.
