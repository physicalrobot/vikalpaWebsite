Dattatreya is a sacred being who appears only to those who are sincerely unaffected by materialism. Many spiritual practitioners who are exclusively pursuing an understanding of the "self" regard him as their <span style="color:turquoise">guru</span>. He is revered as the manifestation of the <span style="color:turquoise">Trimurti</span> (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva). The <span style="color:turquoise">Trimurti</span> in Hinduism represents the primordial forces of existence brought forth by the <span style="color:turquoise">Parabrahman</span> (base reality). They are associated with the first three <span style="color:turquoise">Gunas</span> (qualities) of the Universe:

 - <span style="color:turquoise">Shiva - Tamas</span>: darkness, inertia, lethargy, dullness, illusion, heaviness.
 - <span style="color:turquoise">Brahma - Rajas</span>: energy of passion, emotion, activity, sorrow.
 - <span style="color:turquoise">Vishnu - Sattva</span>: principles of harmony, knowledge, happiness, and goodness.
 
 
These qualities manifest in many different forms all around us. They are involved with every part of Maya, and can be observed in the day, seasons, food, thoughts and actions. For instance, another interpretation suggests that:

 - <span style="color:turquoise">Tamas</span> is the culmination of one's past experiences.
 - <span style="color:turquoise">Rajas</span> is the culmination of one's desires and future expectations.
 - <span style="color:turquoise">Sattva</span> is the present, the dynamic process of consciousness unfolding.

Although most individuals will find their spiritual path by developing a balance within these three domains, Dattatreya has transcended them. He is completely immune to the physical nature of existence, which has opened him up to a pure and sincere pursuit of understanding the self without restrictions. He is often referred to as <span style="color:turquoise">digambara</span> (clad in all directions, or naked), a title reserved in Hinduism for those who have let go of these three <span style="color:turquoise">Gunas</span>. The <span style="color:turquoise">Gunas</span> are also referred to as one of the <span style="color:turquoise">Avaranas</span> (coverings or obstructions) that keep us from realizing true enlightenment and hinder spiritual progress.

The word <span style="color:turquoise">Guru</span> in Sanskrit is composed of two roots: gu, which translates as “darkness,” and ru, which translates as either “remover,” “dispeller,” or “light.” It means one who removes your ignorance (darkness) with the light of wisdom. With this definition, if one is in the appropriate state of mind, almost anything and anyone can become a guru for them. Being a <span style="color:turquoise">digambara</span>, Dattatreya identified 24 gurus from which he learned all he needed to know:


  1. <span style="color:turquoise">Earth</span> - The Earth continues to provide regardless of what the organisms on her do. Teaches perseverance and forgiveness.
  2. <span style="color:turquoise">Wind</span> - Teaches detachment and freedom; it moves everywhere but remains unaffected by its surroundings.
  3. <span style="color:turquoise">Space</span> - Teaches the nature of the soul, which, like the sky, is infinite and untouched by material concerns.
  4. <span style="color:turquoise">Water</span> - Teaches purity and service without ego, cleansing those who come into contact with it, regardless of who they are.
  5. <span style="color:turquoise">Fire</span> - Your knowledge must resemble fire, in that it should purify and transform everything it comes in contact with by providing light and warmth. Teaches the nature of self-purification.
  6. <span style="color:turquoise">Moon</span> - The waxing and waning of the moon don't change the fact that it is always whole. Teaches the transient nature of the body and the permanence of the Atman, which remains unchanged despite external phases.
  7. <span style="color:turquoise">Sun</span> - The sun draws up water from the ground and releases rain, which falls on both the just and unjust alike. Its reflections in puddles of water may seem unique, but they all represent the same celestial object. Teaches to gather knowledge from everywhere, transform it into practical wisdom, and share it with everyone. Also teaches that although the Atman appears in different bodies, it is all from the same source.
  8. <span style="color:turquoise">Pigeons</span> - After trapping a nest of baby pigeons, a hunter lured the parents in and killed them as well. Teaches that even noble desires can entangle and ensnare you.
  9. <span style="color:turquoise">Python</span> - Upon observation, Dattatreya noticed that a Python will eat and then not hunt again for a very long time. Teaches contentment and acceptance of what comes naturally, without excessive effort or desire.
  10. <span style="color:turquoise">Bumblebee</span> - Is active, works hard, but is selective. It pollinates flowers while looking for nectar. Teaches to gather wisdom from different sources but not to hoard or harm others in the process.
  11. <span style="color:turquoise">Beekeeper</span> - Takes more honey than needed to share with others. Teaches to gather wisdom from all, transform it, and then spread it.
  12. <span style="color:turquoise">Hawk</span> - While flying with a big chunk of meat in its beak, the hawk started getting harassed by other birds in the area. Only when the hawk dropped the piece of meat did the other birds stop bothering it. Demonstrates the problems that come with possessing material goods and the peace that comes with renouncing them.
  13. <span style="color:turquoise">Ocean</span> - Receives rivers from everywhere while remaining the same. It maintains its own level. Teaches stability and depth, remaining unaffected by the endless streams of sensory inputs.
  14. <span style="color:turquoise">Moth</span> - Flies directly into the flames that kill it. There are two lessons here. Warns against the dangers of uncontrolled sensory desires, especially visual attractions. Also teaches that once we discover the flame of knowledge, we should plunge directly into it, becoming consumed and transformed.
  15. <span style="color:turquoise">Elephant</span> - A wild bull elephant was lured into a trap as it lusted after a cow elephant. It became enslaved and tamed. Teaches us never to lust after anything, or we will be trapped and enslaved by our senses.
  16. <span style="color:turquoise">Deer</span> - Listens intently, but a hunter's music entrances it, and it gets caught. Warns against the distractions of sound and the dangers of indulging in sensory pleasures.
  17. <span style="color:turquoise">Fish</span> - While swimming along, minding its own business, the fish notices the bait and dies after it grabs it. Warns against greed, especially the desire for food, which can lead to entrapment.
  18. <span style="color:turquoise">Prostitute</span> - Waited all night for her customer, who never showed up. She realized that if she had put her efforts into spiritual self-realization, she would have obtained enlightenment already. Teaches that many people prostitute their time, self-respect, and principles for various reasons but end up feeling dejected. It would be better for them to seek reality.
  19. <span style="color:turquoise">Baby</span> - Babies cry when they are hungry and stop eating when they are full. Teaches to demand only what you really need and take only what you truly require.
  20. <span style="color:turquoise">Maiden</span> - When preparing food for a large group of people, the maiden removes her bangles to create an environment where she can cook without any distractions. Demonstrates the importance of solitude and focus, avoiding unnecessary social interactions.
  21. <span style="color:turquoise">Snake</span> - Makes no hole for itself but instead rests in natural holes or those made by other creatures. It also sheds its skin. Teaches to adjust to your environment without identifying a permanent abode. Remove your old ideas, similar to how a snake molts its skin, and rebirth yourself.
  22. <span style="color:turquoise">Arrowsmith</span> - Dattatreya once observed an arrowsmith who was so lost in creating masterful arrows that he didn't realize when the king and the entire army walked by. Teaches the importance of focus and concentration, which leads to self-realization.
  23. <span style="color:turquoise">Spider</span> - One day, a spider spun a web. A larger spider arrived and started hunting the smaller one. The smaller spider ran for refuge but moved too fast and got entangled in its own web, consequently getting eaten. Teaches not to get entangled in your own web of complicated actions.
  24. <span style="color:turquoise">Caterpillar</span> - After being caught by a bird, the caterpillar was placed into the nest. As the bird began to sing, the caterpillar forgot how much danger it was in. Teaches that one should be absorbed in the eternal sound that is always within you, and let the world go on its way, being aware that all things are impermanent.
