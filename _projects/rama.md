Two concepts that are fundamental to understanding Hinduism are <span style="color:turquoise">Karma</span> and <span style="color:turquoise">Dharma</span>. Karma is the law of cause and effect, where no good or evil is represented through angels and demons. It arises from every action we take, influenced not just by what we do but also by our intentions. Everyone's wellbeing is dictated by Karma, rather than any dogmatic rule of "sin."

Dharma is a deeper concept, referring to the path in one's life that resonates most with them. It is a calling, a way of life that leads to an optimum livelihood for both oneself and those around them.


<h1> The Great Preserver. </h1>

<span style="color:turquoise">Vishwadharma</span> represents the entire Universe's dharma. Just as one's dharma acts as a compass to navigate their life, Vishwadharma serves as the path that will blossom the best reality for all. Preserving the integrity of the Universe's dharmic compass is precisely the role that Lord Vishnu plays in the Hindu pantheon. This is a role he has carried out time and again by manifesting as different Avatars and vanquishing sources of dharmic imbalance.

When he incarnated as his 7th Avatar, <span style="color:turquoise">Sri Rama</span>, he ushered in a legendary era of righteousness. He conquered the evils of his time and improved the lives of all those he came into contact with, including his enemies. He lived a poetically beautiful life, riddled with challenges which he overcame in exemplary fashion. Rama serves as a guide for Hindus today, inspiring them to find the best possible reactions to their situations. Being the embodiment of perfection, he is a guide for those looking to be bold and righteous leaders in every aspect of their lives.

The ancient Rishis discovered that the entire cosmos is as present in every particle in time and space as the macro is holographically inherent in the micro. This led them to believe that they could explore the entirety of the universe by meditating within themselves. Although the roles of Brahmins and Sages were important, Hinduism does not necessitate a priesthood. Yoga is, in fact, an effort to realize this underlying truth within oneself. When acknowledged, this deep epiphany is called <span style="color:turquoise">sat-chit-ananda</span> and can be discovered through many Tantras or methods. One such practice includes the worship of deities.

The deity, or "murthi," represents the micro presence of the macro universal source consciousness. The <span style="color:turquoise">Pran Pratiksha</span> (spiritual consecration of the deity) of Sri Ram in India was a global event for Hindus because it symbolized the Supreme defender of our universal Dharma finally coming back home.
