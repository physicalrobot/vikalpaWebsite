Even the oldest Vedic texts explain that ultimately the entirety of the universe is composed of Shiva and Shakti.

Shiva is that which is not, the forever unchanging constant <span style="color:turquoise">सच्चिदानन्द</span> (eternal truth-consciousness-bliss). Shakti is the creative force in the universe responsible for all physical manifestations, always in perpetual flux and constantly undergoing change. Shakti is the feminine counterpart to Shiva's masculine; it's the counter-clockwise to his clockwise, the Moon to his Sun. Feminine and masculine energies are celebrated for having different roles. The harmony of all relationships between the two is dependent on a spiritual balance, much like the Yin Yang concept in Chinese philosophy. Therefore, it was believed that reality is a consequence of the divine consummation of these two forces of nature.

Shakti is where we get our unbridled strength from. She manifests courage, bravery, and the will to transcend insurmountable odds in the form of Durga. She represents the timeless and formless Mother Nature that brings about the inevitable death of our egos as Maa Kali. She represents the abundance of wealth, fortune, power, and fertility in the form of Lakshmi. And she also represents knowledge, wisdom, art, and learning as Saraswati. 

The Divine Feminine is an aspect of nature that has been worshiped for thousands of years in India. She is a vibrant and omnipresent force that we can reach for whenever we feel the need to empower ourselves against the clutches of self doubt. The <span style="color:turquoise">Mahishasura Mardini Stotra</span> in the image, is an epithet to the goddess Durga. It's about her victory over an extremely powerful and formidable demon, Mahishasura. The story represents overcomming the source of real darkness within us by finding strength where we least expect it. It's concepts like this that make me incredibly proud of my culture. There was a time when our colonizers believed we were akin to cavemen, but in actuality the customs indigenous to India couldn't be more advanced in its treatment towards women. Women all foster the creative force of Shakti within them making them both the source of love and the strength of our civilization. With that being said Shakti at its core is a fundamental part of the universe, and therefore goes beyond gender. Through understanding and embracing the essence of Shakti within us all, we connect not only to an ancient cultural heritage but also to a universal source of power and enlightenment.
