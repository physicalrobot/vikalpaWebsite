In the beginning, there was only the Parabrahman. It is the most supreme, self-existent entity. The only <span style="color:turquoise">"real"</span> entity with no beginning and no end. The absolute reality that escapes description. It is both formless and every form at once. Pure consciousness beyond the boundaries of thoughts and senses. A vast, infinite pool of water both impossibly still and torrential with waves. It is all-pervading and complete. It was only when the Parabrahman willed it, the creation of the material universe was initiated.

A reality capable of being experienced would now manifest. All of existence would, for the first time, become observable, discoverable, and distinguishable. This will of the Parabrahman produced a vibration that reverberated in every direction, forming into the first sound <span style="color:turquoise">üïâ</span> (Aum).

Aum is the sound that contains all other sounds. It's the source from which everything else unpacks itself. As it rippled through reality, it formed the <span style="color:turquoise">Maha Tattva</span> or the primordial element. It was the total material energy of reality, a complete summation of both the <span style="color:turquoise">prakrti</span> (cosmic material) and <span style="color:turquoise">purusa</span> (conscious energy).

From the <span style="color:turquoise">Maha Tattva</span> originated the first three gunas (characteristics/attributes) of the universe:

- <span style="color:turquoise">‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç</span> (Rajas) - quality of passion and action.
- <span style="color:turquoise">‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç</span> (Tamas) - quality of imbalance, disorder, and chaos.
- <span style="color:turquoise">‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ</span> (Sattva) - quality of balance and harmony.

The balance between these gunas is fundamental to the inner workings of the universe. When they came into being, their interplay gave rise to both:

<span style="color:turquoise">Pancha Tattva</span> (five basic elemental attributes)
- Vayu - Air
- Apas - Water
- Agni - Fire
- Prithvi - Earth
- Akasha - Ether

<span style="color:turquoise">Pancha Jnanendriya</span> (five material senses)
- Vision
- Hearing
- Smell
- Touch
- Taste


The journey from the Parabrahman to the physical universe underscores the depth of ancient wisdom encapsulated in the <span style="color:turquoise">Puranas</span>, highlighting how these texts have navigated the complexities of existence and interconnectedness for millennia. It stands as a testament to the enduring insights of ancient philosophies, offering perspectives that remain relevant in understanding the fabric of reality today.
