For many Hindus, Mahavira (Hanuman) represents a beacon of strength when facing the uncertainties of life. He is unwavering and executes tasks with absolute confidence, irrespective of their nature. Always present to uplift those in need, Hanuman approaches even the most daunting challenges in a way that inspires courage in others. While he possesses immense strength, he also understands when restraint is more effective than sheer force. His intelligence and wisdom are unparalleled, and yet, in spite of his formidable abilities, he serves selflessly, devoid of arrogance.

In many families, there are some relatives that are regarded as the "rock", responsible for keeping everyone from going adrift when times are tough.
