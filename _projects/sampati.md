<h3>Part 1</h3> 

The Ramayana is beautiful because of its depth. While it can be read as an epic work of literature, there are layers to the story that can serve as guide posts for navigating one's relationships in life.  

The ancient birds Jatayu and his brother Sampati were both sons of the mighty bird king Aruna. Together they ruled the skies uncontested. When Aruna vacated his throne and left Earth to become the charioteer of Surya Deva, the Sun, the brothers devised a competition to decide who would inherit their father's title. 

It was decided that they would race towards the sun, and whoever turned back first wouldn't be as worthy of a successor. They both immediately took off with incredible speed. As the heat picked up it wasn't long until Sampati realized this display of strength would only lead to their self-destruction. He stared at the determination in his brother's eyes as they flew closer to the flames. Although he wanted to win, the concern for his brother washed over him. He decided to fall back hoping it would mean the end of the race. 

But unfortunately the light from the Sun was too bright and Jatayu didn't realize the race was over. He continued his efforts to win. Just as his feathers were starting to go ablaze; almost immediately the heat dulled, and he was blanketed in a large black shadow. Not being blinded by the Sun anymore, Jatayu watched in horror as his brother Sampati burned with his grand wings spread. Both birds fell from the sky landing in very different parts of the world. Although Jatayu was scorched he would heal thanks to his brother's sacrifice. Sampati on the other hand would never fly again, becoming stranded and lost.  

Sampati's reaction in that moment was emblematic of how real families behave. I can think of many examples within my own family of how my parents or any older relative would reflexively put themselves in harms way to keep me safe. Ambition can be so blinding; and in those moments we tend to hurt people closest to us. Most of the time, we don't realize until the damage is done.
