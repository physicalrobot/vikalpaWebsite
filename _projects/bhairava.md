<span style="color:turquoise">Bhairava</span>, a form of <span style="color:turquoise">Shiva</span>, represents the unrefined, raw truth of realityâ€”a confrontation we all must inevitably face. The goal in Hinduism has always been to transcend into a state of <span style="color:turquoise">Moksha</span>, a liberation from <span style="color:turquoise">Samsara</span> (the eternal cycle of life and death). We are victims of this cycle because of <span style="color:turquoise">Maya</span>, a deep cosmic dementia that obscures our true existential nature. <span style="color:turquoise">Maya</span> causes us to live our lives through a filter that drives us to become the most comfortable we can be.

In Buddhism, it is emphasized that all forms of change come with a measure of discomfort. This discomfort can escalate into fear and anxiety, often leading people to justify self-destructive habits that provide immediate gratification at the cost of something greater down the line. If this is true on a day-to-day basis, then confronting the contrast between true reality and our delusion of it is bound to induce the most fear and anxiety possible. 

It is this fear and anxiety that <span style="color:turquoise">Lord Bhairava's</span> appearance embodies, especially when he confronts us at the time of death. He assumes this terrifying form as he vanquishes any last vestiges of attachment we have left to this life. His presence serves to free us from the illusions that bind us. We must have the courage to face our deepest fears while also developing an awareness grand enough to embrace reality as it is.
