The phrase "Arise! Awake!" championed by Swami Vivekananda from the <span style="color:turquoise">Katha Upanishad</span>, is a thunderous invitation for us to step up to the task of becoming the best versions of ourselves. It encourages individuals to rise from their complacency or ignorance and actively pursue truth and enlightenment. This is not merely an argument for optimism over pessimism but a call for transformative actionâ€”one that requires tenacity and courage. He urges us to confront challenges and persevere until the ultimate goal of self-realization is achieved. Despite acknowledging the difficulty of this path, one should champion the spirit to continue striving regardless. Vivekananda explains that we can develop this initiative by identifying ourselves with the grand nature of the universe that permeates all living beings (<span style="color:turquoise">Atman</span>) instead of our fragile egos. We are all under the influence of <span style="color:turquoise">Maya</span> and must realize that our true nature is capable of anything. 

Life is tough, and can be incredibly hard at times, but you are larger than life. Don't let the shackles of materialism weigh you down, and with this recollection of who you really are, keep pushing forward toward your goals.

"Arise, awake! Awake from this hypnotism of weakness. None is really weak; the soul is infinite, omnipotent, and omniscient." - Swami Vivekananda
