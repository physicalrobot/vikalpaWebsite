 It's said that Lord Shiva would leave for years at a time to undergo deep samadhi. Every now and then when he'd return from his meditation, he was followed around by ganas, human-like hybrid beings. They were his friends and would accompany him wherever he went. 
 One day he comes back only to find a young boy forbidding him entry outside his house. Shiva and his friends were taken aback. The boy weilded a staff, and fiercely demanded they leave at once, threatening to attack if they didn't. Although it was insulting enough to be denied access into one's own house, the boy's tone is what really set Shiva off. After shaking off the child's request and approaching the door, the child made good on his promise and attacked. The strength and conviction of such a young kid surprised Shiva. It wasn't long until his astonshiment devolved into blind anger.
 He swiftly ended the boys life by decapitating his head in a fit of rage with his trident. 
 As soon as the life-less body hit the ground, Shiva realized he made a grave mistake. 

 
 His thoughts were only reassured by the cries of his wife that erupted right after. This time when he was away, she had created a child through the mystical arts of Tantra in attempt to give herself some company. Her new son was keeping watch as she took a bath inside and hadn't had the opportunity to meet his father Shiva yet.



 Seeing the despair in his wife's eyes the full extent of his actions dawned on him. He had a moment of weakness and had allowed himself to become consumed by anger because of it. 
 Although at first he believed the boy's actions to be a threat to his ego, he now understood that it was his inability to control himself which dealt the real damage to his self worth.
