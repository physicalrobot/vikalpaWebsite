"There is an old story about the astronaut who went far out into space and was asked upon his return whether he had been to heaven and seen God.
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">

'Yes,' he said.
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">

'Well, what about God?'
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">

'She is black.'"

â€” Alan Watts

Alan Watts is emphasizing the profoundness of seeing the divine in a non-traditional, non-paternal light.

Watts critiques the common Judeo-Christian concept of God as a paternal, authoritarian figure. He argues that this image is a cultural construct that can make people feel estranged from the true essence of being. Instead, Watts suggests that divinity should not be confined to any specific image or form.

To challenge conventional views, Watts introduces the concept of the goddess <span style="color:turquoise">Kali</span>, who embodies the "negative" or destructive aspects of the universe. <span style="color:turquoise">Kali</span>, with her terrifying appearance and association with death and destruction, represents the essential dark, chaotic, and fearful aspects of existence. Watts argues that this negative principle is vital because it provides contrast and context for appreciating the positive aspects of life. Without the darkness, the light would not be perceivable.

Watts asserts that the negativity associated with the feminine principle, represented by <span style="color:turquoise">Kali</span>, is life-giving and foundational. He explains that our culture often overlooks the importance of the negative, the void, and the space underlying all things. Just as space is essential for stars to shine, the negative is crucial for the positive to exist.

By embracing the image of <span style="color:turquoise">Kali</span> and the concept of the feminine as the fundamental substance of the universe, Watts believes we can develop a more profound and balanced understanding of existence. This perspective helps us recognize that the darkness and the unknown are not to be feared but are integral parts of the whole. Accepting this can lead to a deeper sense of trust and peace, allowing us to let go of our anxieties about survival and control, ultimately leading to greater freedom and love.

In essence, Watts encourages us to see the divine not in rigid, authoritarian terms but as an unfathomable mystery that includes both light and darkness. This broader view can help us find a more meaningful and relaxed approach to life and death.
