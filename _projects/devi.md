In the Vedic tradition, the worship of feminine energy as <span style="color:turquoise">Shakti</span> is deeply symbolic of the power that fuels all creation, transformation, and sustenance in the universe. Shakti is seen as the divine force behind all things, a creative and nurturing power that resides in every aspect of life. This is especially highlighted during <span style="color:turquoise">Navratri</span>, a nine-night festival that celebrates the different forms of the goddess <span style="color:turquoise">Durga</span>, collectively known as the <span style="color:turquoise">Navadurga</span>.

Each day of the festival is dedicated to a different manifestation of Shakti, and these manifestations are closely tied to the life stages of a woman. The festival highlights the divine feminine's journey through various roles in life, from childhood to wisdom and societal leadership. Worship during Navratri is a means to connect with these phases, reflect on personal growth, and invoke the blessings of the goddess. The goddesses of the nine nights are as follows:

<ol>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Shailputri</span> represents the first phase of a womanâ€™s life, as a daughter. She is the beginning of feminine energy and symbolizes innocence and purity.</li>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Brahmacharini</span> embodies the student phase, where a woman learns and grows, building strength and resilience for what lies ahead.</li>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Chandraghanta</span> represents readiness for marriage. She shares the crescent moon of her husband, symbolizing unity and partnership in this new stage of life.</li>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Kushmanda</span> is the phase where a woman becomes ready to create life. "Ku" means little, "ushma" refers to warmth or energy, and "anda" means egg, symbolizing her potential to give birth.</li>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Skandamata</span> represents motherhood, nurturing the child and guiding them through early life.</li>
</ol>

<p align="center">
  <b>From this point, the journey turns inward:</b>
</p>

<ol start="6">
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Katyayani</span> marks the beginning of the internal battles. She is the warrior goddess who defeats Mahishasura, representing the fight against inner struggles like fear, anxiety, and anger, as well as external challenges like societal expectations, and patriarchal structures.</li>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Kalaratri</span> is the phase where a woman embraces all the chaos in her life, both positive and negative. She gains empowerment by confronting and integrating these aspects of herself.</li>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Mahagauri</span> represents wisdom gained through experience, a woman who has become an inspiration to others by her grace and resilience through life's trials.</li>
  <li><span style="color:turquoise">Siddhidatri</span> is the culmination of this journey, where a woman has gained the wisdom and power to uplift society as a whole. She symbolizes the ultimate completeness of feminine energy.</li>
</ol>
