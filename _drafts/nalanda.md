It underscores the tragic historical pattern where invaluable knowledge was lost due to the hubris and tyranny of those in power. Humanity's intellectual progress has been repeatedly stymied by shortsightedness and conflict. I heard once that history is written by the winners, and that we all must submit to the biases of those with larger egos before us. 

This artwork serves as a powerful reminder of the immense loss humanity suffers when it allows knowledge to be destroyed, urging us to break the cycle of rediscovery by preserving and cherishing our collective wisdom.
