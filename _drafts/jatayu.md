The Ramayana is beautiful because of its depth. While it can be read as an epic work of literature, there are layers to the story that can serve as guide posts for navigating one's relationships in life.  

The ancient birds Jatayu and his brother Sampati were both sons of the mighty bird king Aruna. Together they ruled the skies uncontested. When Aruna vacated his throne and left Earth to become the charioteer of Surya Deva, the Sun, the brothers devised a competition to decide who would inherit their father's title. 

It was decided that they would race towards the sun, and whoever turned back first wouldn't be as worthy of a successor. They both immediately took off with incredible speed. As the heat picked up it wasn't long until Sampati realized this display of strength would only lead to their self-destruction. He stared at the determination in his brother's eyes as they flew closer to the flames. Although he wanted to win, the concern for his brother washed over him. He decided to fall back hoping it would mean the end of the race. 

But unfortunately the light from the Sun was too bright and Jatayu didn't realize the race was over. He continued his efforts to win. Just as his feathers were starting to go ablaze; almost immediately the heat dulled, and he was blanketed in a large black shadow. Not being blinded by the Sun anymore, Jatayu watched in horror as his brother Sampati burned with his grand wings spread. Both birds fell from the sky landing in very different parts of the world. Although Jatayu was scorched he would heal thanks to his brother's sacrifice. Sampati on the other hand would never fly again, becoming stranded and separated from his brother. Sampati's reaction in that moment is emblematic of how real families are. I can think of many examples within my own family of how my parents or siblings would reflexively put themselves in harms way to keep me safe.   

Realizing what his stubbornness had cost him, Jatayu went into full remorse. He flew around the world looking for his brother, never being able to find him. After years of searching he gave up in despair. The pain of living at the cost of his brother ate away him. In order to find the strength to go on, he made a pact with himself to commit his wings to the service of someone else's well-being, just as Sampati had done.

It wasn't long until Jatayu got the opportunity to vindicate his inner conflict. On a bright day as he was flying over a patch of forest, he witnesses a fearsome rakshasa kidnapping a woman getting away on his chariot. 

She was screaming <span style="color:turquoise"> "राम!" </span> (Ram) at the top of her lungs, desperately hoping for someone to hear her. Without a moment's hesitation, Jatayu knew his time had come. Many legends have been written about what happens next. With all the existential resolve possible, Jatayu attacks his foe with immense ferocity. He destroys the chariot and even kills the charioteer and the horses. 

But this was no ordinary rakshasa; it was the mighty king Ravan. Ravan had never tasted defeat so the damage he sustained made him well up with rage. His ego wouldn't allow him to lose to a bird. After a fight that seemed to last forever, Ravan finally ended the assault by landing a fatal attack. He sliced a wing off Jatayu forcing the bird to crash some distance away. 

Despite going down, Jatayu persisted in being "useful" by repeating the name he had heard the girl scream over and over; <span style="color:turquoise"> "राम!" </span> (Ram). He believed that if he could just hang on long enough to help her, his brother's sacrifice could mean something. Fortunately his efforts weren't in vain. A man who he presumes is Ram finds him. After relaying what happened to his wife he lets go. Jatayu dies, finally feeling worthy enough to be king of the birds.
