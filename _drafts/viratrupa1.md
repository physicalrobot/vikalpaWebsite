Rama is a figure in Hinduism that embodies perfection. He's a culmination of the best characteristics one should have when going through life. Being the epitome of perfection, whether it be as a brother, or a son he never fails to pick the path of least karmic resistance. His sincere ability to follow his dharma inspired those around him, including his enemies, to do better. 

During his adolescence he was sent along with his brother, Lakshmana, to train with the great sage Vishwamitra. In Santana Dharma it is believed that those who we consider as our "Guru" are a tier higher than the "Divine" itself. A Guru is someone who illuminates the darkness of your ignorance with knowledge, so that you can find your own path. It's a sacred relationship much like the one established between parent and child. When Ram accepted Brahmarishi Vishwamitra as his guru, he commited himeself completely to his teachings.    

This level surrender is necessary in order to truly benefit from a Guru. One must rely soley on the fact that their Guru, much like a parent, will always do things with the student's best interest at heart.
